# berkeley_sda_data
This notebook uses selenium to navigate through the Berkeley Survey Documentation and Analysis (SDA) to download Networth studies from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) subsite.

### Usage:
1. Manually run each cell in Step 01.  This will result in you having to respond to the download dialog box from Firefox.
2. Choose "save file", and then follow the instructions from cell Step 02.
3. Then run the rest of the cells to see the graph of the data aggregation.

### Important
This version of sel_scrape and selenium probably will not work with versions of Firefox new than version 53.  To get that version for the Mac, see the project https://github.com/bgithub1/selscrape.
